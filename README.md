# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to understand the succession planning required for HR and management to effectively manage the transition of employees that will be exiting the workforce and creating a plan to ensure the knowledge transfer occurs through a mentorship program to the next generation of employees to begin knowledge transfer. 

## Results

* 90,398 employees will be retiring based on a retirement age of 67-70 yrs. 

*  70% of the employees that are eligible for retirement are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. 
*  The biggest impact for retirement will be to the Engineering Department -- 29,414 Senior Engineers; 14,222 Engineers, 4,502 Technique Leaders, and 1,761 Assistant Engineers.

*  Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary 

* The organization will need to fill  72,458 roles as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.

* There are more than enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees, however, there are not enough candidates that are eligible for mentorship. The ratio of mentors to mentees would be 46:1. There is a significant gap to be filled with the knowledge transfer of 15% of employees. We would need to expand the criteria for mentees.

* We would need to further analyze the salaries for retirement-ready and mentor-eligible candidates to fill the gap of retirees. Due to the massive amount of knowledge transfer required, there would be overlap in cost for duplicate titles for a period of time during transition / handover periods.
